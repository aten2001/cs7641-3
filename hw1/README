### To Run Code ###
In order to run the code, simply use the following bash command:
$ python main.py

Alternatively, you can open up python and run:
>>> from main import *
>>> main()

This trains and tests 5 different classifiers on both data sets, calculating
their performance as a function on training set size. Then it plots the results.
The code currently does not use the whole data set, but nonethless uses a very
large amount. Thus, it may take VERY long to run.

If you want to reduce the sample sizes to decrease the run time (normally it's very
long) modify lines 78, 139, and 141. Be warned however that the 7 labels of the
forest cover type data set are not uniformly distributed, and if the sample sizes
are too small and you get an unlucky draw, you won't have all 7 forest cover types
represented in your training set. Consequently, the ANN training module will have
an error.

### Software information ###

### Folders ###
There are 4 folders included:

code: contains the single code file, main.py
data: contains the data sets
results: contains the results from my own experiments, which are used to
         generate the plots in my report
graphics: contains the plots I used in my report

+ 1 file: vma3-analysis.pdf, which is my report
